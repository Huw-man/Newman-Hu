                    <p>Hello! I'm currently a junior studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC
                        Berkeley.
                        I am interested in VR/AR technology as well as robotics and AI. At school, besides studying, I
                        love
                        exploring the outdoors and playing board games and sports. My favorite board game is
                        Settlers of Catan which I have played through nearly all the expansions. My other passions are
                        basketball and soccer which I play on intramural teams at Berkeley.</p>
